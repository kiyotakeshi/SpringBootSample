# About MVC

## Model

- model takes charge in logic
    - main work is to get data from DB

## View

- view takes charge in display using html

## Controller

- controller requests processing to model class upon user request

## Sequence

1. request from user to server(ex. enter UserID and password and sent)

2. controller accepts and requests to model

3. model sends the processing result to controller

4. controller deside which view return to user

## Why use MVC model

- can develop separate with role

- easier to reuse and expand
